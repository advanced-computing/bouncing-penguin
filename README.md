## Project Description

This project analyzes MTA Daily Ridership Data to examine COVID-19 recovery patterns across different transit modes in New York City. We explore how subway, bus, and commuter rail ridership has changed over time and compare the recovery rates of different transportation methods.

## Research Questions

1. How has MTA ridership recovered since COVID-19 across different transit modes?
2. Which transit modes have recovered faster - subway, bus, or commuter rail?
3. Are there seasonal patterns in the ridership recovery?
